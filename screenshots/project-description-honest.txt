DUITNOW QR SCANNER MOBILE APP
React Native Learning Project - Android QR Code Scanner Prototype
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW

A React Native mobile application that scans CIMB DuitNow QR codes and simulates a payment flow. This is a frontend prototype/learning project built on Windows that demonstrates QR scanning, data extraction, and mobile UI design skills.

The app allows users to scan QR codes using their camera, automatically extracts the recipient's name from the QR data, lets them enter a payment amount, and displays a simulated transaction confirmation. No actual payments are processed - this is purely a UI/UX demonstration.


WHAT THIS APP DOES

1. Scan CIMB DuitNow QR codes using device camera
2. Extract recipient name from QR code data using regex
3. Enter payment amount with automatic MYR currency formatting
4. View transaction confirmation screen
5. Display success receipt with transaction details
6. Save transaction log to local device storage

Built for Android only (no iOS version as I developed this on Windows without Xcode).


KEY FEATURES

QR CODE SCANNING
- Live camera scanning using react-native-vision-camera
- Can also scan QR codes from gallery images
- Custom camera overlay with scanning frame
- Extracts recipient name automatically from QR data

PAYMENT FLOW SIMULATION
- Amount input with real-time MYR formatting (e.g., 100 becomes 1.00)
- Confirmation screen showing payment details
- Success screen with transaction receipt
- Generated reference numbers (9-digit OCTO format)
- Timestamp for each transaction

UI/UX
- 5-screen flow: Homepage → Scanner → Amount → Confirm → Success
- Clean interface inspired by CIMB Bank app
- Gradient backgrounds and professional styling
- Malay language interface ("Imbas QR", "DuitNow QR")

LOCAL STORAGE
- Saves transactions to markdown file on device
- Format: "Transaksi: [Name], MYR [Amount], [Timestamp]"


TECHNICAL STACK

Framework: React Native 0.79.2 + TypeScript 5.0
Platform: Android only

Main Libraries:
- react-native-vision-camera - Camera access
- vision-camera-dynamsoft-barcode-reader - QR detection
- react-native-image-picker - Gallery selection
- jsqr - QR decoding from images
- react-native-fs - Local file storage
- react-native-linear-gradient - UI gradients
- react-native-vector-icons - Icons

Code: ~550 lines of TypeScript in App.tsx


WHAT I LEARNED

- React Native development with TypeScript
- Integrating camera APIs and QR scanning libraries
- Regex pattern matching for data extraction from QR codes
- Real-time input formatting and validation
- Mobile UI/UX design following banking app patterns
- Local file system operations in React Native
- Android permissions handling


IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS

This is NOT:
✗ A production payment app
✗ Connected to any real banking system or API
✗ Processing actual money transfers
✗ Secure for real financial transactions
✗ Built for iOS (Windows dev environment only)

This IS:
✓ A learning/portfolio project
✓ A frontend UI prototype
✓ A demonstration of React Native skills
✓ Showing QR scanning implementation
✓ Android-only application


WHY THIS PROJECT MATTERS

For Clients:
Shows I can build Android mobile apps with React Native, implement QR scanning features, and create professional-looking interfaces. The skills demonstrated here (library integration, UI design, data processing) are transferable to real client projects.

For Recruiters:
Demonstrates practical mobile development skills:
- React Native + TypeScript
- Third-party library integration (camera, QR scanning, storage)
- Mobile UI/UX implementation
- Problem-solving (regex extraction, formatting)
- Android development basics

Honest about scope: This is a solo learning project suitable for a junior/mid-level developer portfolio. It shows ability to learn new technologies and build complete features, even if not production-scale.


TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

DATA EXTRACTION
- Used regex pattern `59(\d{2})([\w\s\(\)\.\,\-]+)60` to extract names from CIMB QR format
- Handles various name formats with spaces and special characters

DUAL SCANNING
- Primary: Real-time camera scanning
- Backup: Gallery image scanning with JPEG decoding

FORMATTING LOGIC
- Input formatter: Converts typed numbers to decimal format automatically
- Display formatter: Shows clean currency values (removes extra zeros)
- Validation: Prevents invalid or zero amounts


PROJECT METRICS

- 550+ lines of TypeScript code
- 5 functional screens
- 10+ libraries integrated
- 1 developer (solo project)
- Android only
- No backend/API


WHAT'S NEXT

To make this production-ready, it would need:
- Backend API integration
- Real payment gateway connection
- User authentication
- Security features (encryption, secure storage)
- iOS version (requires macOS development)
- Proper testing and error handling
- Team code review


CONTACT

Available for:
- Android mobile app development (React Native)
- Mobile UI/UX implementation
- QR/barcode scanning features
- Prototype/MVP development

Currently learning:
- iOS development (need macOS setup)
- Backend integration
- Production deployment

Open to junior/mid-level positions or freelance projects where I can apply and grow these skills.
